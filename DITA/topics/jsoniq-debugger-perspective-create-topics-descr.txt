The JSONiq Debugger perspective allows you to detect problems in a JSONiq transformation by executing the process step by step in a controlled environment. It is fine-tuned for transforming and querying JSON content.

The JSONiq Debugger is very similar to the XSLT Debugger and XQuery Debugger perspectives, so its documentation should be similar too. Use the published WebHelp content for more information about these debugger perspectives and to see how their topics are structured.
